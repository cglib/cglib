/**
 * Generates classes to handle multi-valued keys, for use in things such as Maps and Sets.
 * Code for <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods follow the
 * the rules laid out in <i>Effective Java</i> by Joshua Bloch. 
 * <p>
 * To generate a <code>KeyFactory</code>, you need to supply an interface which
 * describes the structure of the key. The interface should have a
 * single method named <code>newInstance</code>, which returns an
 * <code>Object</code>. The arguments array can be
 * <i>anything</i>--Objects, primitive values, or single or
 * multi-dimension arrays of either.
 * <p>
 * Once you have made a <code>KeyFactory</code>, you generate a new key by calling
 * the <code>newInstance</code> method defined by your interface.
 * <p>
 * This example should print <code>true</code> followed by <code>false</code>:
 * <p><pre>
 *   import net.sf.cglib.KeyFactory;
 *   public class KeySample {
 *       private interface MyFactory {
 *           public Object newInstance(int a, char[] b, String c);
 *       }
 *       public static void main(String[] args) {
 *           MyFactory f = (MyFactory)KeyFactory.create(MyFactory.class, null);
 *           Object key1 = f.newInstance(20, new char[]{ 'a', 'b' }, "hello");
 *           Object key2 = f.newInstance(20, new char[]{ 'a', 'b' }, "hello");
 *           Object key3 = f.newInstance(20, new char[]{ 'a', '_' }, "hello");
 *           System.out.println(key1.equals(key2));
 *           System.out.println(key2.equals(key3));
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b>
 * <code>hashCode</code> equality between two keys <code>key1</code> and <code>key2</code> is guaranteed if
 * <code>key1.equals(key2)</code> <i>and</i> the keys were produced by the same factory.
