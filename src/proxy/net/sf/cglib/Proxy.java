/**
 * This class is meant to be used as a implementation of
 * <code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code> under JDK 1.2. There are some known
 * subtle differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The exceptions returned by invoking <code>getExceptionTypes</code>
 * on the <code>Method</code> passed to the <code>invoke</code> method
 * <b>are</b> the exact set that can be thrown without resulting in an
 * <code>UndeclaredThrowableException</code> being thrown.
 * <li>There is no protected constructor which accepts an
 * <code>InvocationHandler</code>. Instead, use the more convenient
 * <code>newProxyInstance</code> static method.
 * <li><code>net.sf.cglib.UndeclaredThrowableException</code> is used instead
 * of <code>java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException</code>.
 * </ul>
