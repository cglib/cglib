/**
 * <b>DOCUMENTATION FROM APACHE AVALON DELEGATE CLASS</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * Delegates are a typesafe pointer to another method.  Since Java does not
 * have language support for such a construct, this utility will construct
 * a proxy that forwards method calls to any method with the same signature.
 * This utility is inspired in part by the C# delegate mechanism.  We
 * implemented it in a Java-centric manner.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Delegate</h2>
 * <p>
 *   Any interface with one method can become the interface for a delegate.
 *   Consider the example below:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   public interface MainDelegate {
 *       int main(String[] args);
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *   The interface above is an example of an interface that can become a
 *   delegate.  It has only one method, and the interface is public.  In
 *   order to create a delegate for that method, all we have to do is
 *   call <code>MethodDelegate.create(this, "alternateMain", MainDelegate.class)</code>.
 *   The following program will show how to use it:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   public class Main {
 *       public static int main( String[] args ) {
 *           Main newMain = new Main();
 *           MainDelegate start = (MainDelegate)
 *               MethodDelegate.create(newMain, "alternateMain", MainDelegate.class);
 *           return start.main( args );
 *       }
 *
 *       public int alternateMain( String[] args ) {
 *           for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
 *               System.out.println( args[i] );
 *           }
 *           return args.length;
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *   By themselves, delegates don't do much.  Their true power lies in the fact that
 *   they can be treated like objects, and passed to other methods.  In fact that is
 *   one of the key building blocks of building Intelligent Agents which in tern are
 *   the foundation of artificial intelligence.  In the above program, we could have
 *   easily created the delegate to match the static <code>main</code> method by
 *   substituting the delegate creation call with this:
 *   <code>MethodDelegate.createStatic(getClass(), "main", MainDelegate.class)</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Another key use for Delegates is to register event listeners.  It is much easier
 *   to have all the code for your events separated out into methods instead of individual
 *   classes.  One of the ways Java gets around that is to create anonymous classes.
 *   They are particularly troublesome because many Debuggers do not know what to do
 *   with them.  Anonymous classes tend to duplicate alot of code as well.  We can
 *   use any interface with one declared method to forward events to any method that
 *   matches the signature (although the method name can be different).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Equality</h3>
 *  The criteria that we use to test if two delegates are equal are:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>
 *       They both refer to the same instance.  That is, the <code>instance</code>
 *       parameter passed to the newDelegate method was the same for both. The
 *       instances are compared with the identity equality operator, <code>==</code>.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>They refer to the same method as resolved by <code>Method.equals</code>.</li>
 *   </ul>
