      <p>

          This project is inspired by java.lang.reflect.Proxy, 
          but CGLIB proxy generator is more powerfull 
          and can be used by JDO/ODMG or EJB implementations. 
          It can extend any not final class and implement interfaces at runtime.


          CGLIB outputs generated classes. Byte code generation and class file
          format manipulation is hidden in static methods. 
          It was designed to implement Transparent Persistence for JAVA, 
          but can be used to implement aspects like Security or Validation.
